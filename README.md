# Astro and Tailwind Example

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Tailwind within Astro.  

For this project, I used [Astro Add Tailwind 4](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#tailwind) as a Vite plugin.  So everything is there, you just need to `npm run install` and then `npm run dev`

Astro and Tailwind rebuilds based on code changes you make!  Thank you Astro, Tailwind, and Vite for making this so easy!

## To start

```
npm run install
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
